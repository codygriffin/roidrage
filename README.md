# RoidRage

This is an ongoing experiment in game development.  Some parts are horribly overdesigned, others are woefully incomplete.  This is a rough port from an Android game...

Requires glfw3

note: kinda portable, but this will only build on OS X Mavericks at the moment...

```bash
$ make alpha.run -j # Run original (ported from Android)
$ make beta.run -j  # RTS development
```
